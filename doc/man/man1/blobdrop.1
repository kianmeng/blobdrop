.SH NAME
blobdrop \- Quickly drag and drop files from the terminal

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B blobdrop
[\-hvfiklnpt]
[\-x \fISTR\fP]
.I FILES

.SH DESCRIPTION

.P
This program allows you to drag files directly from the terminal to other applications.
It can be used both as a source (files can be dragged from the terminal) and as a sink (dropped file names will be printed in the terminal).

Filenames can either be given as command line arguments or by piping them into stdin, one filename per line.

Several frontends are available to drag files from. By default, blobdrop will automatically determine the best frontend, meaning that for passed files it will immediately start the drag operation without having to hold down the mouse while showing a window when no files are passed.
The frontend can be manually selected with the \-\-frontend option.

.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Show help.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-version
Show version information.
.TP
.B \-b, \-\-frameless
Show a frameless window.
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-frontend
Selects the frontend. Must be one of {auto (default), gui, immediate, notify, stdout}. For a more detailed explanation of the frontend options see
.B FRONTENDS
below.
.TP
.B \-k, \-\-keep
When using sink mode, keep dropped files around by default.
.TP
.B \-p, \-\-persistent
Do not auto-hide the main window while dragging.
.TP
.B \-t, \-\-ontop
Keep the window on top of other windows.
.TP
.B \-x, \-\-auto-quit \fISTR
Changes the conditions when blobdrop will automatically quit. Must be one of {never, first, all}. For never it will never automatically quit, for first it will quit after the first drag and for all (default value) it will quit once every path has been dragged at least once.

.SH EXIT STATUS
Returns zero on success.

.SH FRONTENDS
Blobdrop has multiple frontends available that change the behaviour how the drag and drop operation starts.
.SS "Automatic"
This is the default frontend and chooses one of the following frontends automatically based on some conditions. On X11, the
.B immediate
frontend is used unless no file is passed, in which case the
.B gui
frontend is started instead. On Wayland the
.B gui
frontend is used in all cases due to limitations of the Wayland protocol.

.SS "Gui"
This frontend shows an user interface that lists all items. Each item can be conveniently dragged on its own, or alternatively there is a button to drag all items at once.

.SS "Immediate"
This frontend starts the drag operation automatically without showing a GUI inbetween. The user does not need to hold any mouse button and can just move the mouse cursor to the target location and then click once to drop the files. Due to limitations of Wayland, this option is only available on X11. This option also works over XWayland, but then the target drop location is required to be running in XWayland too. Native Wayland does not support this option, because wl_data_device::start_drag() requires an implicit grab.

.SS "Notify"
This frontend spawns a notification containing the URLs of the files to drag in the
.I x\-kde\-urls
field. Window managers with support for this field then enable the notification to be dragged itself into other application windows. This option is mainly useful on KDE Plasma.

.SS "Stdout"
This frontend simply prints all files in the terminal as OSC8 links. Terminal emulators with support for OSC8 could allow the user to drag and drop such links directly. This option is equivalent to "ls --hyperlink=always".

.SH EXAMPLE
